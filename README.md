Random scripts I find useful or I've developed to get more familiar with python.

The scripts generally have more info inside them. 

[mkv2srt.py](https://github.com/xelfer/scripts/blob/master/mkv2srt.py) A script to rip SRT/SSA subtitles out of MKV files with ffmpeg

[parsewd.py](https://github.com/xelfer/scripts/blob/master/parsewd.py) A simple script to parse /etc/passwd

[atlassian.py](https://github.com/xelfer/scripts/blob/master/atlassian.py) A script which prints out all Sydney jobs and their URLs at Atlassian
